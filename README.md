# Inclusion Proyect

Proyect context and description

The technical test involves developing a small functionality in SpringBoot (Java) as per a provided link. Additionally, an API with GET and POST services needs to be implemented for sending input parameters and receiving functionality output. Request and response body can be in XML or JSON format. The developed functionality must include unit tests. Java 11 is required, while the version of SpringBoot can be chosen by the user. The test evaluates software development skills, adherence to good practices, code quality, and documentation completeness. Upon completion, the test should be emailed with execution instructions, completion notification, repository upload, documentation, and a brief development overview with tool usage details.

Features, Scope & Requirements

   -Problem to solve: https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1374/A;
  
   -Deploy it on AWS;
  
   -Build a Frontend;
  
   -Perform a complete Readme;
  
   -Integrating it with Sonar is optional but it adds up;
  
   -Perform unit tests;
  
   -Comment the code;
  
   -Carry out validations of the parameters in the services;
  
   -Implement an error control system.

## Solution

The final solution is an architecture MVVM with a REST service API and a frontend client to interchange data. 
We don't need to scale;
We don't have special security requirements:
We don't have persistence. 
We don't have special consumers or different behaviors by device.

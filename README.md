# Inclusion Proyect

Proyect description

Below I give you the data of the technical test that I would like you to carry out in order to identify your capabilities in relation to the technical level required in the project: this technical test consists of the development in SpringBoot (Java) of a small functionality defined in the next link:In addition to what is indicated in this link, you are requested to implement an API with a GET service, and another POST, that allows sending the input parameters (x, y, n) necessary to execute the functionality indicated above, and that returns a response with the output of that same functionality. The format of the request and response body can be XML or JSON. Unit tests of the developed functionality must be included. The version of Java to be used will be Java 11, and the version of SpringBoot will be left to the user's own choice. Once finished, you will have to send the test by email indicating everything necessary to be able to execute it, informing us of its completion and upload to the repository.The objective of this test is to check the skills when carrying out software development tasks, as well as the evaluation of the use of good practices, cleanliness, order, and quality of the implemented code. All documentation and information on how to execute it, and how the tests should be carried out, must also be uploaded, as well as a short introduction of how it was developed and what tools have been used (will be positively valued).
